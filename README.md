# Customer-Segmentation
It's a project based on Mall data and in this I have applied Kmeans and PCA algorithms to perform Customer Segmentation more accurately. 
# In Detail Description
The data is acquired from kaggle to test my theoretical knowledge and get a experience in customer segmentation area. In this project I have applied my skills like data Analysis and data Visualization. I have worked on different ML models like KMeans and PCA.Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning. It is a statistical process that converts the observations of correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated features with the help of orthogonal transformation.
